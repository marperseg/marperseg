### ðŸ’¬ ABOUT ME: 
Programming has always been a critical part of my career and I developed a keen interest in this field. I graduated as a full stack developer and, besides my experience, I consider myself with the ease and the willingness to learn. In addition to my technical knowledge, I work great with others and have favorable communications and leadership skills. I also have ability to adapt myself to evolving work environments, and to manage responsibilities and challenging situations. My main goal is to progress as a software developer while contributing with my work. **
